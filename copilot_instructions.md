## AI Light Show System - Current State & Instructions

### **Project Overview**
This is an AI-powered light show system that synchronizes DMX lighting with music. The system uses FastAPI backend, React/Preact frontend, and integrates with Mistral AI for natural language lighting control.

**üö´ DEPRECATED: Cue System Removed**
The entire cue-based lighting system has been removed and replaced with a new DMX Canvas approach. All cue-related functionality has been deprecated.

### **DEPRECATED - Previous Accomplishments (Cue System Removed)**

#### **1. AI Action Command System - DEPRECATED ‚úÖ**
- **Problem Solved**: AI was generating vague commands like "Add some cool lights"
- **Solution**: Enhanced Mistral prompt with mandatory command structure
- **Result**: Now generates specific commands like "ACTION: Add bright white strobe effect during the drop using all RGB fixtures"

#### **2. Cue Management Improvements - DEPRECATED ‚úÖ**
- **Problem Solved**: Cues had duration=0 and type="Unknown", AI actions weren't saved
- **Solution**: Enhanced `CueManager.add_cue()` and `execute_confirmed_action()`
- **Result**: Proper defaults, automatic saving, detailed logging

#### **3. Cue Interpreter Enhancements - DEPRECATED ‚úÖ**
- **Problem Solved**: Complex commands like "strobes during the drop" failed
- **Solution**: Added smart timing/fixture fallbacks and pattern recognition
- **Result**: 5/5 test commands now execute successfully

#### **4. Frontend Chat Interface - JUST COMPLETED ‚úÖ**
- **Added**: Scrollable chat container (max 10 rows)
- **Added**: Auto-scroll to latest message
- **Status**: Ready for AI conversation testing

### **DEPRECATED - Key Files (Cue System Removed)**

#### **Backend Files:**
1. **ollama_client.py** - DEPRECATED: Mistral prompt system enhanced for cues
   - DEPRECATED: Added mandatory ACTION command structure for cues
   - DEPRECATED: Enhanced with 9 success tips and examples for cues
   - DEPRECATED: Fixed `execute_confirmed_action()` to use global cue_manager and auto-save

2. **DEPRECATED: cue_service.py** - Cue management (removed)
   - DEPRECATED: Enhanced `add_cue()` with defaults and detailed logging
   - DEPRECATED: Fixed duration/type handling

3. **DEPRECATED: cue_interpreter.py** - Command parsing (removed)
   - DEPRECATED: Added beat timing patterns ("on beat hits", "for X beats")
   - DEPRECATED: Improved fixture detection ("left side lights", "all RGB fixtures")
   - DEPRECATED: Better musical timing fallbacks

4. **websocket_service.py** - Updated action execution
   - DEPRECATED: Added cue broadcasting after AI actions
   - DEPRECATED: Enhanced confirmation flow for cues

#### **Frontend Files:**
5. **ChatAssistant.jsx** - Just improved
   - Added scrollable container: `max-h-60 overflow-y-auto`
   - Added auto-scroll: `useRef` + `useEffect` for latest message visibility

### **Current System Capabilities**

#### **AI Command Processing:**
- ‚úÖ Natural language ‚Üí specific ACTION commands
- ‚úÖ Musical timing intelligence ("during the drop", "at the chorus")
- ‚úÖ Fixture group recognition ("all RGB fixtures", "left side lights")
- ‚úÖ Effect specification (colors, presets, timing)
- ‚úÖ Automatic saving and persistence
- ‚úÖ Real-time feedback and confirmation flow

#### **Supported Command Examples:**
```
User: "Add some strobes during the drop"
AI: "ACTION: Add bright white strobe effect during the drop using all RGB fixtures"
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - specific, executable, automatically saved
```

### **DEPRECATED - Technical Architecture (Cue System Removed)**

#### **DEPRECATED - AI Flow:**
1. User types message in chat
2. WebSocket sends to `_handle_user_prompt()`
3. Streams response from Mistral with enhanced prompt
4. DEPRECATED: Extracts ACTION commands with `extract_action_proposals()`
5. DEPRECATED: Shows confirmation prompt to user
6. DEPRECATED: On "yes", executes via `execute_confirmed_action()`
7. DEPRECATED: Uses `CueInterpreter` ‚Üí `CueManager` ‚Üí auto-saves ‚Üí broadcasts updates

#### **DEPRECATED - Key Components:**
- **Mistral AI**: DEPRECATED: Enhanced with specific lighting prompt and ACTION structure for cues
- **DEPRECATED: CueInterpreter**: Smart command parsing with musical/fixture intelligence
- **DEPRECATED: CueManager**: Proper defaults, logging, persistence
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication with streaming support
- **Frontend**: Scrollable chat with auto-scroll and markdown support

### **DEPRECATED - Previous Status (Cue System Removed)**

#### **What Was Working (Now Deprecated):**
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Complex AI lighting commands execute successfully
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Musical synchronization and timing detection
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Fixture group and positioning logic
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Automatic cue saving and persistence
- ‚úÖ Real-time chat interface with streaming
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Action confirmation workflow for cues
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging and debugging

#### **DEPRECATED Test Results:**
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: 5/5 enhanced commands execute successfully
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Timing patterns work: "beat hits", "during drop", "for 8 beats"
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Fixture detection works: "parcans", "left side lights", "moving heads"  
- ‚ùå DEPRECATED: Colors parsed correctly: "bright white", "blue", "multi-colored"

### **Current Focus - New DMX Canvas System:**
The system has moved from cue-based control to a new DMX Canvas approach for direct lighting control.

### **Instructions for New Development:**
Focus on the new DMX Canvas system rather than the deprecated cue system. The AI chat interface remains functional for general lighting discussions.

**System Migration**: Transitioned from cue-based lighting control to DMX Canvas direct painting approach! ÔøΩ
