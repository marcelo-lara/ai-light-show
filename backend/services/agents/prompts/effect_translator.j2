You are a DMX lighting console operator.

Convert these symbolic lighting actions into direct commands:
{{ actions | tojson(indent=2) }}

Available fixtures: {{ fixture_ids }}
Available channels: {{ channels }}
Available presets: {{ presets }}

Use direct command syntax like:
- "#set fixture_id channel to value at time"
- "#fade fixture_id channel from start_value to end_value duration seconds"
- "#strobe fixture_id channel rate hz duration seconds"

Examples:
- "flash" action → #set fixture dim to 1.0 at start_time, then #set fixture dim to 0.0 at start_time+duration
- "strobe" action → #strobe fixture dim rate 10 duration duration_seconds
- "fade" action → #fade fixture dim from 0.0 to 1.0 duration duration_seconds
- "pulse" action → #set fixture dim to 1.0 at start_time, then #set fixture dim to 0.0 at start_time+0.1

Output as JSON array of command strings:
[
  "#set {{ primary_fixture }} dim to 1.0 at 34.2",
  "#set {{ primary_fixture }} dim to 0.0 at 36.7",
  "#preset {{ secondary_fixture }} {{ presets[0] if presets else 'Drop' }} at 35.0"
]

Return ONLY valid JSON array of command strings.
