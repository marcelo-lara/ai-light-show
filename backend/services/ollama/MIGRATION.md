# Ollama Services Migration

## Overview
The Ollama AI services have been moved from `backend/ai/` to `backend/services/ollama/` to better organize the codebase.

## Files Moved
The following files were moved from `backend/ai/` to `backend/services/ollama/`:

- `ollama_client.py` - Main client entry point
- `ollama_api.py` - Core API communication
- `ollama_health.py` - Health checking and status
- `ollama_conversation.py` - Conversation management
- `ollama_instructions.py` - System instruction generation
- `ollama_actions.py` - Action proposal and execution

## Import Changes
All imports have been updated from:
```python
from ..ai.ollama_client import function_name
```

To:
```python
from ..services.ollama import function_name
```

## Files Updated
The following files had their import statements updated:

### Backend Services
- `backend/services/websocket_service.py` - Updated ollama imports for chat functionality

### API Routers  
- `backend/routers/ai_router.py` - Updated all ollama function imports

### Internal Ollama Files
- `backend/services/ollama/ollama_instructions.py` - Updated relative imports
- `backend/services/ollama/ollama_actions.py` - Updated relative imports  
- `backend/services/ollama/ollama_conversation.py` - Updated relative imports

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Updated reference to ollama file location
- `backend/ai/README_REFACTORING.md` - Added migration note

## Package Structure
A new `__init__.py` file was created at `backend/services/ollama/__init__.py` that re-exports all the main functions for easy importing.

## Verification
All imports have been tested and are working correctly. The migration maintains full backward compatibility for all function calls and API interfaces.

## Benefits
- Better organization: AI services are now properly grouped under services
- Clearer separation: Audio analysis AI remains in `ai/`, while chat/LLM services are in `services/`
- Consistent structure: Follows the pattern of other service modules
